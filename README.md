### Face Detection and Tracking
This project is a program to detect and track faces in real-time video using various
image processing techniques.

**Project Objectives**

- 1. Create a real-time face detector using Haar Cascade.
- 2. Implement face tracking for detected faces using the CSRT method (track the first face
detected by the Haar Cascade).
- 3. Apply real-time image processing techniques (described below) to the video, controlled via
specific keyboard keys.

**Program Specifications**

- The program should start by detecting faces in the real-time video and allow the user to toggle
between the following functions by pressing the specified keys:
    -  **Key C:** Toggle between face detection using Haar Cascade and face tracking using the CSRT
method. Tracking should begin from the first face detected by the Haar Cascade.
    - **Key B:** Toggle a blurring effect on the detected or tracked face(s).
    - **Key E:** Toggle the video view between edge-only display (edge detection) and normal mode.
    - **Key G:** Toggle the video between color and grayscale.
    - **Key Q:** Exit the program and close the display window.
